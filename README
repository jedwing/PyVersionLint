==================
PyVersionLint 0.01
==================

This is a set of PyLint plugins I quickly hacked together for detecting usage
of features which were added in Python 2.4 or Python 2.5 for a project where it
was important to ensure Python 2.3 compatibility, even though primary
development was being done on Python 2.5.

I will eventually expand this to include Python 2.6 features as well.  I have
no current plans to handle earlier Python releases.  I've also considered
creating plugins to detect usage of deprecated or removed modules, but have no
immediate need for such plugins.

For usage details, see the pyver.sh script in the scripts directory.  The two
functional plugins at present are:

    pyver/py23_checker.py: Check for 2.4-isms which won't work in 2.3
    pyver/py24_checker.py: Check for 2.5-isms which won't work in 2.4

There is also a pyver/py25_checker.py, but it does not presently have any
checks in it.  It does contain, in comments, a summary of what I understand to
have changed between 2.5 and 2.6, based on a careful scouring of the 2.6
release notes, or at least those changes which I believe are detectable via a
PyLint plugin.  (That is, mostly either language features, new modules, new
functions, new arguments to old functions, etc.)
